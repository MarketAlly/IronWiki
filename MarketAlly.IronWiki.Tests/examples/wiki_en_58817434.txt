The '''2019 [[Houston Astros]] season''' was the [[List of Houston Astros seasons|58th season]] for the [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise located in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], their 55th as the Astros, seventh in both the [[American League]] (AL) and [[American League West|AL West]] division, and 20th at [[Daikin Park|Minute Maid Park]].  They entered the season as having set a franchise record with 103 wins, defending two-time AL West champions, both with 100 or more wins, an unprecedented feat for Houston.  Having reached a second consecutive [[2018 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] (ALCS), their 2018 season ended in a 4-games-to-1 loss to the eventual [[2018 World Series|World Series]] champion [[2018 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]].  

Starting the 2019 season, the Houston Astros began airing their weekly night games on [[KTRH|KTRH 740]].  On March 28, [[Justin Verlander]] made his second [[List of Houston Astros Opening Day starting pitchers|Opening Day start]] for the Astros at [[Tropicana Field]], who defeated the [[2019 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]], 5–1.  Outfielder and designated hitter [[Yordan Alvarez]] made his major league debut in June, set a number of records and rare feats, and proceeded to win the AL [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Month Award|Rookie of the Month Award]] each of his first three months. 

For the third consecutive season, the Astros sent six players to the [[2019 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] held at [[Progressive Field]] in [[Cleveland]], the most in baseball, including four starters: [[Alex Bregman]], [[Michael Brantley]], [[Justin Verlander]], and [[George Springer]]; pitchers [[Gerrit Cole]] and [[Ryan Pressly]] were also selected. 

At the July trade deadline, the Astros acquired starting pitchers [[Zack Greinke]]—adding a seventh 2019 All-Star to their roster—and [[Aaron Sanchez (baseball)|Aaron Sanchez]].  In his Astros debut on August 3, Sanchez tossed the first six innings of a combined [[no-hitter]] versus the [[2019 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]], while Greinke was 8–1 with a 3.02 [[earned run average]] (ERA) over 10 starts for Houston.  On September 1, Verlander pitched his third career no-hitter against the [[2019 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] while striking out 14.  The 12th and 13th no-hitters in club history, it marked the first time that Houston authored two in the same season.  Verlander also recorded his 3,000th career strikeout on September 28.

On September 18, the Astros clinched a [[2019 Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]] berth against the [[2019 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] and became the first team since the [[2002 New York Yankees season|2002]]—[[2004 New York Yankees season|2004 New York Yankees]] to produce three consecutive 100-win seasons.  On September 22, the Astros clinched their third straight AL West title.  For the first time in franchise history, the Astros led baseball with the best regular-season record of 107–55, surpassing the club record of 103 wins set the season before.  The AL West title signaled the 13th [[Major League Baseball postseason|playoff]] appearance—the fourth since moving to the American League—and 10th division title in franchise history.

In the [[2019 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] (ALDS), Houston defeated the [[2019 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] by a margin of three games to two.  They proceeded to defeat the [[2019 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in the [[2019 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] by a margin of four games to two, capped by [[League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award#American League winners|ALCS MVP]] [[Jose Altuve]]'s deep series-ending, [[walk-off home run]].  Hence, the Astros secured their second [[List of American League pennant winners|AL pennant]], third league pennant overall, and a trip to the [[2019 World Series|World Series]] for the second time in three years.  However, Houston were defeated by the [[2019 Washington Nationals season|Washington Nationals]] in seven games, a result of the first occurrence in a major league postseason series in which the road team won each of the seven games.

Following the season, Verlander was recognized with his second career [[Cy Young Award]], while becoming the third Astro to garner the award.  The Astros led the league with a record six players selected to 2019's inaugural [[All-MLB Team]], including Altuve, Alvarez, Bregman, Cole, Greinke and Verlander.  Bregman and Springer were honored with AL [[Silver Slugger Award]]s, while Greinke was likewise named along with a [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]] based on his play in the [[National League (baseball)|National League]].  Alvarez, who exhibited the highest [[Slugging percentage|slugging]] and [[on-base plus slugging]] percentages for rookies in history, was opted as the AL [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]].

This was the Astros' final season with [[A. J. Hinch]] as manager and [[Jeff Luhnow]] as general manager; both were fired in January 2020 after MLB investigators confirmed that [[Houston Astros sign stealing scandal|the team had used electronics to steal opponents’ signs]] back in the 2017 regular season.

On September 8, [[Gerrit Cole]] struck out 15 batters over eight innings in a 21–1 victory over the [[2019 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]].  He became just the second pitcher to strike out 14 or more hitters in three consecutive games, joining Pedro Martínez in 1999.  It was the sixth outing of the season of at least 10 strikeouts and no walks for Cole, tying the major league record.  The 15 strikeouts tied Verlander's Minute Maid Park record, set earlier in the season on June 12 versus the Brewers.  It was Cole's 12 consecutive decision won, dating back to May 27, with the Astros going 16–2 in those 18 starts.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/gerrit-cole-makes-strikeout-history |title=Cole, Pedro only pair to accomplish this feat |work=MLB.com |language=en |date=September 8, 2019 |access-date=September 9, 2019}}</ref>

The Astros established a major league record on September 9 by hitting six home runs within the first two innings of a 15–0 rout of the A's.  [[Robinson Chirinos]] and Yordan Alvarez each homered twice, and [[Alex Bregman]], [[Jose Altuve]], and [[Michael Brantley]] all added home runs to give the Astros a club record-tying seven in the game.{{refn|The Astros previously hit seven home runs in a single game once, on September 9, [[2000 Houston Astros season|2000]], versus the [[2000 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]]|group=lower-alpha|name="club home run record"}}  Alvarez (24) passed Correa for the club rookie record for home runs, while increasing his RBI total to 72, which tied for second-highest total through the first 71 games of a career in major league history.{{refn|Alvarez' 72 RBI tied [[Ted Williams]] ([[1939 Major League Baseball season|1939]]) and [[Rudy York]] ([[1937 Major League Baseball season|1937]]), and trailed [[Walt Dropo]]'s 80 ([[1949 Major League Baseball season|1949]]–[[1950 Major League Baseball season|50]]).|group=lower-alpha|name="rookie RBI"}}  Former Astro [[Mike Fiers]] (14–4), starting for Oakland, allowed career-highs of both nine runs and five home runs on nine hits in one-plus innings.

The 32 runs were second in major league history within a nine-inning span only to the [[2007 Texas Rangers season|2007 Texas Rangers]], which included a record 30–3 win over [[2007 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore]], per the [[Elias Sports Bureau]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.espn.com/mlb/recap?gameId=401076887 |title=Astros hit record 6 HRs in 2 innings, def.

On September 18 versus Texas, Cole struck out his 300th batter of the season, [[Shin-Soo Choo]], in a 3–2 win.

==== Performance overview ====
Having roared to club-record 107 victories while winning the third of three division titles for the second time in franchise history ([[1997 Houston Astros season|1997]]—[[1999 Houston Astros season|1999]] [[National League Central]] division titles), manager [[A. J. Hinch]] likewise joined [[Larry Dierker]] as the second Houston manager to guide the Astros to such a feat.  Hinch also became the first Astros manager to guide his club to three consecutive 100-win seasons, while having broken the club record for wins for a second consecutive year (103 in [[2018 Houston Astros season|2018]] and 107 in 2019).<ref name=timeline/>

The Astros' [[slugging percentage]] of .495 set the major league record.  They led the major leagues in [[bases on balls]] (645 BB), [[batting average]] (.274) and [[on-base percentage]] (.352 OBP), while surrendering the second-fewest runs (640), and ranked second in [[fielding percentage]] (.988).  Houston pitching fanned the most hitters (1,671), while their lineup were retired via the fewest strikeouts (1,166).<ref name=timeline/> 

Verlander and Cole, anchoring the [[starting rotation]], each turned in a sub-3.00 [[earned run average]] (ERA), attained 20 [[Win–loss record (pitching)#Winning pitcher|wins]], and 300 [[strikeout]]s, becoming the first teammate duo to actualize the latter two since [[Randy Johnson]] (24–5 W–L, 2.32 ERA, 334 K) and [[Curt Schilling]] (23–7 W–L, 3.23 ERA, 316 K) with the [[2002 Arizona Diamondbacks season|2002 Arizona Diamondbacks]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ARI/2002.shtml |title=2002 Arizona Diamondbacks statistics |work=Baseball-Reference.com |access-date=October 12, 2025}}</ref>  Further, Verlander and Cole virtually replicated each other's production, combining to lead the AL in the pitching [[Triple Crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] categories,{{refn|Composed of leading the league in each of wins, strikeouts and ERA.|group=lower-alpha|name="Triple Crown"}}<ref name=ptc>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/pitrip.shtml |title=Triple Crown of pitching |work=Baseball Almanac |access-date=September 21, 2025}}</ref> and led or placed in the top five in virtually every other measure.
