A '''bridge''' is a [[Structure#Load-bearing|structure]] that crosses an obstacle such as a river, lake, railroad, road, or ravine. Its primary function  is to [[transportation|transport]] vehicles, trains, and pedestrians, but bridges may also accommodate pipelines, buildings, wildlife, and canals.  Basic structures used in bridge design include [[Arch bridge|arches]], [[Truss bridge|trusses]], [[Beam bridge|beams]], [[Cantilever bridge|cantilevers]], [[Suspension bridge|suspension cables]], and [[Cable-stayed bridge|cable-stays]]. Bridges are configured in a variety of forms, such as [[viaduct]]s, [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]], [[Trestle bridge|trestles]], [[movable bridge]]s, double-deckers, [[pontoon bridges|pontoons]], and [[military bridge|portable military bridges]]. They may also be categorized by their materials, which include wood, brick, stone, iron, steel, and concrete. 

The history of bridges reflects the evolution of humankind's engineering technologies.  The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[History_of_China#Ancient_China|ancient Chinese]] built major bridges of stone and timber. During the [[Renaissance]], advances in science and engineering led to wider bridge spans and more elegant designs. [[Concrete]] was perfected in the early 1800s, and proved to be superior to stone in many regards.  With the [[Industrial Revolution]] came mass-produced steel, which enabled the creation of  [[suspension bridge|suspension]] and [[cable-stayed bridge]]s that could span wide obstacles.

The design of a bridge must satisfy many requirements, such as connecting to a transportation network, providing adequate [[Clearance (civil engineering)#Vertical clearance|clearances]], and safely transporting its users. Additional factors include cost, aesthetics, and longevity.  A bridge must be strong enough to support the weight of the bridge itself, as well as the traffic passing over the bridge. It must also tolerate stresses imposed by the environment, such as  wind, snow, earthquakes, water currents, flooding, and [[Thermal expansion|temperature fluctuations]]. To meet all these goals, bridge engineers use analytical methods such as [[limit state design]] and [[finite element method]].

Many bridges are admired for their beauty, and some serve important roles as iconic landmarks that provide a sense of pride and identity to a community.  Bridges are often used as metaphors in art and literature to represent connection or transition. Bridges can have a significant impacts – both positive and negative – on a community's environment, society, and economy. Positive effects can include shorter transport times, more employment opportunities, increased wages, improved productivity, and increased gross domestic product. Negative impacts of bridges can include contributions to global warming, increased traffic accidents, income inequities, and increased pollution.

In the late 1700s, the design of arch bridges was revolutionized in Europe by [[Jean-Rodolphe Perronet]] and [[John Rennie the Elder|John Rennie]]. They   designed arches that were flatter than semi-circular Roman arches.  This yielded faster construction times, better water flow under the bridge, and  more slender piers.  These designs were used for bridges such as [[Pont de la Concorde (Paris)|Pont de la Concorde]] and [[New London Bridge]].<ref name=rennie>{{Multiref

The abundance of inexpensive [[lumber]] in North America caused [[timber bridge|timber]] to be the most common material used for bridges there from the late 1700s to the late 1800s. Many of these timber bridges were [[covered bridges]].  Rail bridges used timber to obtain long spans that utilized strong truss designs, and also tall [[trestle bridge]]s that spanned deep ravines.<ref name=timber>{{Multiref

The purpose of any bridge is to traverse  an obstacle. A bridge can provide support and transport for railways, cars, pedestrians,  pipelines, cables, or any  combination of these.{{sfn|Tang|2014|p=1}} [[aqueduct (bridge)|Aqueducts]] were developed early in human history, and carried water to towns and cities.{{sfn|Brown|2005|pp=8,18,20-23}} Canal systems sometimes include [[navigable aqueduct]]s (also called ''canal bridges'') to carry boats across a valley or ravine.{{sfn|Brown|2005|p=53}}

Until the early 19th century, most bridges were designed to carry pedestrians, horses, and horse drawn carriages.{{sfn|Brown|2005|p=64}} But following the invention of railways, many [[rail bridge]]s were built: in Britain, the number of bridges doubled during the railway-building boom in the mid 1800s.{{sfn|Brown|2005|p=64}}  The explosive growth of motorway networks in the 20th century required bridges to span ever longer distances to reach islands and cross valleys.{{sfn|Bennett|2000||p=17}}

Railway bridges have unique requirements because of the heavy loads they carry{{snd}}a single [[locomotive]] can weigh {{convert|197|tonnes|short ton}}.{{sfn|Sorgenfrei|2014|p=144.}}<!-- source says 435,000 lbs -->   Railway bridges are designed to minimize [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] (bending under load), to maximize [[Structural robustness|robustness]] (localize the damage caused by accidents), and to tolerate [[Impact (mechanics)|heavy impacts]] (sudden shocks from, for example, rail wheels striking an imperfection in the track).{{sfn|Sorgenfrei|2014|p=144}}  These requirements lead railways to avoid curved bridges, suspension bridges, and cable-stayed bridges;  instead,  straight beam or truss bridges are commonly used.{{sfn|Sorgenfrei|2014|p=146}}

Some bridges accommodate uses other than transportation. [[Pipeline bridge]]s carry oil pipes or water pipes across valleys or rivers.{{sfn| Dusseau|2002}} Many historical bridges supported buildings, such as shrines, factories, shops, restaurants, and houses. Notable examples were the Old London Bridge and [[Ponte Vecchio]].{{sfn|Cruickshank|2010|pp= 144- 175}} In the modern era, [[bridge-restaurant]]s can be found at some highway [[rest area]]s; these support a restaurant or shops directly above the highway and are accessible to drivers moving in both directions.{{sfn|Greco|2016|pp=89-100}}

Some bridges combine two types of basic structures.{{sfn|Tang|2014|p=4}} For instance, the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] is primarily a suspension structure, but also uses cable-stays.{{sfn|Bennett|1999|p=157}}  Some multi-span bridges use different basic structures for different spans{{snd}}for example, the following bridges (all of which cross the [[ Firth of Forth]]) use  beam or truss structures on the outer spans, but use another structure for the wide central span(s): [[Forth Bridge]] (cantilever central spans), [[Forth Road Bridge]] (suspension central span), and [[Queensferry Crossing]] (cable-stayed central spans).

===Design process===
<!--
[[File:Sandhill Road overpass.jpg|thumb|alt=A freeway with several cars driving on it, with two concrete bridges passing overhead| Many overpass bridges in the United States [[Interstate Highway System]] are concrete [[box girder bridge]]s, such as these bridges over [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]] in California.]]
-->
The process for designing a new bridge typically goes through several iterations, progressively refining the design.{{sfn|Tang|2014|p=2}}  An early step in the design process{{snd}}sometimes called ''conceptual design''{{snd}}is to  consider the multiple requirements that a bridge must satisfy.{{sfn|Tang|2014|p=2}}. The requirements may be categorized as engineering requirements and non-engineering requirements. Engineering requirements include safety, strength, lifespan, climate, traffic, the size and nature of the obstacle to be traversed, and clearance required for passage underneath.<ref>{{Multiref

|{{harvnb|Barker|2007|pp=45–50}}.
|{{harvnb|Hu|2016|pp=106–108}}.
}}</ref> Non-engineering requirements include construction cost, maintenance cost, aesthetics, time available for construction, owner preference, and experience of the builders.<ref>{{Multiref
|{{harvnb|Tang|2014|p=3}}.
|{{harvnb|Barker|2007|pp=45–46, 96–108}}.
|{{harvnb|Barker|2007|p=114}}.
}}</ref> Other factors that may be weighed include impact to environment and wildlife; and the bridge's economic, social, and historic relationship to the local community.{{sfn|Hu|2016|pp=98,106-108}}

After the requirements of a bridge are established, a bridge designer uses [[structural analysis]] methods to identify candidate designs.{{sfn|Barker|2007|pp=283-288}} Several designs may meet the requirements. The [[value engineering]] methodology can be used to select a final design from multiple alternatives.{{sfn|Hu|2016|pp=69-72}} This methodology evaluates candidate designs based on weighted scores assigned to several different criteria, such as: cost, service life, durability, availability of resources, ease of construction, construction time, and maintenance cost.{{sfn|Hu|2016|p=71}} After considering all factors, a bridge designer{{snd}}in consultation with the owner{{snd}} will select a particular design.<ref>{{Multiref

===Specifications and standards===
One of the requirements a new bridge must satisfy is compliance with the local bridge design specifications and codes.  In some cases, these are legally binding requirements.{{sfn|Tang|2014|p=3}}  In many countries, the specifications are developed and published by [[standards organizations]]  that define acceptable bridge-building practices and designs.  In Europe, the organization is the [[European Committee for Standardization]], and the standards it publishes are the [[Eurocodes]].{{sfn|"Eurocodes: Building the Future". ''European Commission'' }} In the United States, the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) publishes the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications.{{sfn|"AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications"}}{{efn|A list of some bridge-related specifications in the US is found in ''[[#CITEREFTroitsky1994|Planning and Design of Bridges]]''.{{sfn|Troitsky|1994|pp=177-179}}}} Canada's bridge standard is the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code, developed by the non-profit [[CSA Group]].{{sfn| "CSA S6:19, Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code". ''CSA Group'' }} Agencies that regulate [[aviation safety|aviation]] or  [[waterway]]s may also impose standards that dictate some aspects of a  bridge design, such as requirements for  [[Aviation obstruction lighting|aviation warning lights]] at the top of bridge towers, or [[Navigational aid|navigational warning lights]] on bridge supports located in [[navigable waterway]]s.<ref>{{Multiref

===Service life===

-->
Designers may choose to use a double-deck design (also known as double-decked or double-decker), which carries two decks on top of each other. This technique can be used to increase the amount of traffic a bridge can carry; or when the location constrains the size of the bridge.{{sfn|Kumar|2025}} Double-deck bridges also permit two different kinds of traffic to be safely carried.  For example,  motor vehicles can be separated from pedestrians or railways.{{sfn|Kumar|2025}}

An early double-deck bridge was [[Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge]], which carried rail on the upper deck, and carriages and pedestrians on the lower deck.{{sfn|Brown|2005|pp=9, 87}} [[George Washington Bridge]] in New York carries 14 motor vehicle lanes (eight above, six below), and is the world's busiest bridge, carrying over 100 million vehicles annually.{{sfn|"2024 Monthly Traffic and Percent of E‐ZPass Usage".

A bridge design must accommodate all loads and forces that the bridge might reasonably experience. The totality of the forces that the bridge must tolerate is the [[structural load]], which is often divided into three components:  dead load, live load, and environmental load. The [[Structural load#Dead load|dead load]] is the weight of the bridge itself.{{efn|The dead load also includes any permanent fixtures on the bridge, such as light poles, traffic signage, and guardrails;{{sfn|Barker|2007|p=161}}}} The [[Structural load#Live load|live load]] is all forces and vibrations caused by traffic passing over the bridge, including weight, braking, and acceleration.  The [[Structural load#Environmental load|environmental load]] encompasses all forces applied by the bridge's surroundings, including weather, earthquakes, mudslides, water currents, flooding, [[Subsidence|soil subsidence]], [[frost heaving]], [[Thermal expansion|temperature fluctuations]], and [[Bridge strike|collisions]] (such as a [[Ship collision|ship striking]] the pier of a bridge).<ref name=load>{{Multiref

====Return period====
Many load sources vary over time, such as vehicle traffic, wind, and earthquakes. A bridge designer must anticipate the maximum values that those loads are likely to reach during the bridge's lifespan.{{sfn|Barker|2007|p=161}} For sporadic events like floods, earthquakes, collisions, and hurricanes, bridge designers select a maximum severity that the design must accommodate.{{sfn|Barker|2007|pp=197, 201}} The severity is based on the [[return period]], which is average time between events of a given magnitude.  Return periods range from 10 to 2,500 years, depending on type of event and the country in which the bridge is located.<ref>{{Multiref

}}</ref> Longer return periods are used for bridges that are a critical part of the transportation infrastructure. For example, if the bridge is a key lifeline in case of emergencies, the designer may utilize relatively long return period, such as 2,000 years; in this example, the design must endure the strongest storm that is expected to happen once every 2,000 years.{{sfn|Barker|2007|pp=161, 197, 201}}

The load forces acting on a bridge cause the components of the bridge to become [[Stress (mechanics)|stressed]]. Stress is a measure of the internal force experienced within a material. Strain is a measure of how much a bridge component bends, stretches, or twists in response to stress. Some strain (bending or twisting) may be acceptable in a bridge component if the material is [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]]. For example, steel can tolerate some stretching or bending without failing. Other materials, such as concrete, are [[Elasticity (physics)|inelastic]], and their change in shape when stressed is negligible (until the stress becomes excessive and the concrete fails).<ref name=stressstrain>{{Multiref

}}</ref>

A bridge designer must calculate the maximum stress that each bridge component will experience, then select an appropriate design and size for the components to ensure they will safely tolerate the loads on the bridge. Stresses are categorized based on the nature of the force that causes the stress, namely: compression, tension, shear, and torsion. [[Compression (physics)|Compression]] forces compact a component by pushing inward (for example, as felt by a bridge foundation when a heavy tower is resting on it). [[Tension (physics)|Tension]] is a stretching force experienced by a component when pulled (for example by the cables of a suspension bridge). [[Shear force|Shear]] is a sliding force experienced by a component when two offset external forces are applied in opposite directions (for example, during an earthquake when the upper part of a structure is pulled north, and the lower part is pulled south). [[Torsion (mechanics)|Torsion]] is a twisting force.<ref name=stress>{{multiref

}}</ref> For roadways, the loads imposed by truck traffic far exceed the loads imposed by passenger cars, and so the bridge design process focuses on trucks.{{sfn|Barker|2007|pp=164-165}}

The loads created by trains and vehicles can be determined by modelling, or by relying on data and algorithms contained in engineering specifications published by organizations such as [[Eurocode]] or [[AASHTO]].{{sfn|Ellobody|2014|pp=4-7,24}} Alternatively, [[weigh-in-motion]] technology can measure loads on existing bridges with comparable traffic patterns, providing real-world data which can be used to evaluate a proposed bridge design.{{sfn|O'Brien|2015|pp=41-43}}

A bridge designer evaluates the output of the models to determine if the design meets the design goals.

The structural elements of a bridge are generally divided into the  [[Substructure (engineering)|substructure]] and the [[superstructure#Bridges|superstructure]].{{sfn|Zhao|2017|pp=4-7}}  The substructure consists of the lower portions of the bridge, including the [[foundation (engineering)|footing]]s,{{efn|The term ''[[foundation (engineering)|foundation]]'' is sometimes used to represent footings, but in most contexts ''foundation'' means all or most of the substructure.{{sfn|Elnashai|2000|pp=530-531}}}} [[abutment]]s, [[Pier (bridge structure)|pier]]s, [[piling]]s, anchorages, and [[bridge bearing|bearing]]s.{{sfn|Zhao|2017|pp=6,7}}  The superstructure rests upon the substructure, and consists of the [[Deck (bridge)|deck]],   trusses, arches, towers, cables, beams, and girders.<ref>{{Multiref

===Construction process===

Construction of a bridge is typically managed by [[construction engineer]]s, who are responsible for planning and supervising the construction process.   Important aspects of this role include budgeting, scheduling, periodically conducting formal [[design review]]s, and communicating with the bridge designers to interpret and update the [[Engineering drawing|design plans]].<ref>{{Multiref
|{{harvnb|Durkee|2014|pp=24-25}}.
|{{harvnb|Blank|2014|pp=67-71}}.
}}</ref>{{efn|An example schedule for design reviews is to hold them at 33%, 65%, 95%, and 100% of bridge completion.{{sfn|Blank|2014|p=70}}}}

The forces experienced by a bridge during construction can be larger or have a different nature than the forces it will experience after completion. The bridge design process typically focuses on the strength of the fully completed bridge, but it should also consider the unusual stresses that individual elements will experience during construction.  Special  techniques may be required during construction to avoid excessive stresses, such as temporary supports under the bridge, temporary bracing or reinforcement, or permanently strengthening  specific elements.<ref>{{Multiref

When an existing bridge is being replaced or refurbished, the impact on traffic flow can have a detrimental effect on residents and services.

Construction of all bridge types begins by creating the substructure.

[[Cantilever bridge]] superstructures are usually built incrementally by proceeding outward from anchorages or piers.

A similar process is used for steel or concrete cantilevers: prefabricated sections may be positioned at ground (or water) level and hoisted into place with a gantry, or may be transported horizontally along the previously completed portion of the cantilever. Concrete cantilevers require steel prestressing cables to be passed through tubes within each section and tightened, which will put the concrete into compression.<ref>{{Multiref

Before building the cables of a suspension bridge, temporary [[Footbridge#Catwalk|catwalk]]s must be constructed to support the wires while they are drawn across the span and over the tops of the towers.{{sfn|Gimsing|1997|pp=419-424}} There are two approaches to pulling the wires across the span: the air spinning method (in which individual wires are carried across by pulleys); and the prefabricated strand method (in which entire strands are pulled across).<ref>{{Multiref

The [[Deck (bridge)|deck]] of a bridge is the horizontal, continuous surface that extends across the full span of a bridge, and  upon which vehicles or pedestrians travel.  Decks generally rest on beams or box girders.  When a deck is rigidly attached to its supporting beams or girders they function together as a single structure.<ref name=deckgirder>{{Multiref

They are useful in applications where weight is critical, a thin deck is required, or the environment is subject to earthquakes or extreme cold weather.{{sfn|Mangus|2014|pp=590, 604}}

Many decks have a wearing surface on top, which is a layer of material  designed to be periodically replaced after it is worn away by vehicular traffic.

Constructing the deck (and its supporting beams or girders) can be difficult when the bridge is over water or a deep valley.  A variety of techniques are available, and the choice depends on factors such as  the topography of the site, the deck material (concrete or steel), traffic or obstacles under the bridge, and whether sections can be built off-site and transported to the bridge.  Methods of deck construction include  building atop [[Falsework#In_bridge_construction|temporary supports]], [[Jack (device)|jacking up]] from the ground, [[incremental launching]] (building the entire deck on the approach road and pushing it horizontally),  lifting from below with a [[Hoist (device)|hoist]] mounted on the bridge, [[Cantilever#In_bridges,_towers,_and_buildings|cantilevering]] (incrementally extending the deck, starting from towers or abutments),   and lifting with a [[Crane vessel|floating crane]].<ref name=constrMethod>{{Multiref

''Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District''}}  ]]
-->
To achieve the designed service life, a bridge must be protected from deterioration by incorporating certain features into the design. Bridges can deteriorate due to a variety of causes, including rust, corrosion, chemical actions, and mechanical abrasion. Deterioration is sometimes visible as rust on steel components, or cracks and [[spall#Spalling in refractory concrete|spalling]] in concrete.{{sfn|Mulheron|2000|pp=805-807}}. Deterioration can be slowed with various measures, primarily aimed at excluding water and oxygen from the bridge elements.{{sfn|Mulheron|2000|pp=807-808}} Techniques to prevent water-based damage include drainage systems, waterproofing membranes (such as polymer films), and eliminating [[expansion joints]].{{sfn|Mulheron|2000|pp=810-815}}{{efn|Expansion joints relieve stress due to thermal expansion and contraction, but permit water to seep into vulnerable bridge elements, which can lead to corrosion and degradation. [[Integral bridge]] concepts are an alternative to expansion joints.{{sfn|Mulheron|2000|pp=815-816}} }}

Concrete bridge elements can be protected with waterproof seals and coatings.{{sfn|Mulheron|2000|pp=816-822}}{{efn|Concrete can deteriorate by  the process of [[carbonatation]], or by penetration of [[chloride ion]]s, typically from salt.

[[Bridge scour]] is a potentially serious problem when bridge footings are located in water. Currents in the water can cause the sand and rocks around and below the footings to wash-away over time. This effect can be mitigated by placing a [[cofferdam]] around the footings, or surrounding the footings with [[rip-rap]].<ref>{{Multiref
|{{harvnb|Mulheron|2000|pp=842–844}}.
|{{harvnb|Kashima|Sakamoto|1998|pp=72–73}}.

Suspension bridges and cable-stayed bridges have large cables containing hundreds of steel wires. Several techniques are used to minimize corrosion inside the cables, such as wrapping the cables with galvanized wire, injecting the cables with grout or epoxy, using interlocking S-profile wires, and circulating dry air through the interior of the cable.{{sfn|Gimsing|1997|pp=557-559,604-605}}

Bridges with supports in navigable waterways should be designed to withstand reasonable [[ship strike]]s.  In addition to waterway markings  and pilot warning systems, bridge supports in water may be surrounded by physical protections such as [[fender (boating)|fenders]], [[Dolphin (structure)|pilings]], or small artificial islands.{{sfn|Knott|Prucz|2014|pp =107-109}}

==Operation==

===Management===
After a bridge is completed and becomes operational, management processes are employed to ensure that it remains open to traffic, avoids safety incidents, and achieves its intended lifespan. These processes{{snd}}collectively referred to as ''bridge management''{{snd}} include technical activities such as maintenance, inspection, [[Structural health monitoring|monitoring]], and testing.{{sfn|Vassie|2000|pp=849-859}}  In addition to technical tasks, management encompasses planning, budgeting, and prioritization of maintenance activities.{{sfn|Vassie|2000|pp=849-859}} Bridge managers use methodologies such as [[bridge management system]]s and  [[life-cycle cost analysis]] to manage a bridge and estimate the maintenance costs of a bridge throughout its lifetime.<ref>{{Multiref

Maintenance activities seek to prolong the life of the bridge, reduce lifecycle costs, and ensure the safety of the community.{{sfn|Alampalli|2014|pp=269-272}}   Maintenance tasks can be categorized as corrective tasks and  preventive tasks.{{sfn|Alampalli|2014|pp=276,282}}   Corrective tasks are implemented in response to unexpected issues that arise, such as repairing structural elements (piers, beams, girders, towers, or cables) and replacing bearings.{{sfn|Alampalli|2014|pp=288-292}}

An important part of maintenance is inspecting a bridge for damage or degradation, and taking steps to mitigate any issues detected. Degradation can come from a variety of sources: expansion/contraction from freeze/thaw cycles, rain and snow, oxidation of steel, saltwater spray, [[carbonatation]] of concrete, vehicular traffic, corrosion, mechanical abrasion, poor bridge design, and improper repair procedures.<ref>{{Multiref

To evaluate the condition of large steel cables, electrical coils are moved along the cable, measuring the induction of the cable, which can reveal corrosion issues.{{sfn|Abdunur|2000|pp=912-914}} Detailed measurements of the external surface of a bridge can be recorded using [[lidar]] technology. Comparing measurements taken at multiple points in time can reveal long-term changes.{{sfn|Omer|2018 }}

A variety of [[Structural testing|structural tests]] may be performed to evaluate a bridge's condition. One test involves placing loads in selected locations on the bridge, and measuring the resulting deflections: sensitive instruments measure how much the bridge elements bend or twist, and the results can reveal if the element is not performing within expected limits. Another test involves jacking the bridge deck off its supports slightly, and measuring the force required. Cables can be evaluated by vibrating them and measuring their dynamic response.{{sfn|Abdunur|2000|pp=915-934}}

Some testing{{snd}}termed [[destructive testing]]{{snd}}requires removing samples from the bridge and taking them to a laboratory for analysis with microscopes, sonic devices, or X-ray diffraction.{{sfn|Abdunur|2000|pp=896-898, 955}} Destructive testing is performed on samples such as [[Core sample|cores drilled]] from concrete, or a small piece of steel wire cut from a cable.{{sfn|Abdunur|2000|pp=896-898, 955}}{{efn|1=The process of cutting-out a small piece of wire from a large cable of a heavily trafficked suspension bridge is seen in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMbiq5aleOc&t=74 this video].}}

Bridges can have a significant impacts{{snd}}both positive and negative{{snd}} on a community's environment, society, and economy.   Positive effects can include shorter transport times, employment opportunities, improvements to social equity, improved productivity, and increases to  the [[gross domestic product]].  Negative impacts of bridges can include contributions to global warming,  increased traffic accidents, workplace injuries, corruption, and increased pollution (during construction, from maintenance work, and from vehicular traffic).  During the bridge design process, these effects may be modeled with [[sustainability]] methodologies such as [[Life-cycle assessment|life cycle sustainability assessment]] or  [[Building information modeling in green building |building information modeling]], and the results can be used to adjust the bridge's design to improve its effect on the environment, society, and economy.<ref name=sustain>{{Multiref

===Profession and regulation===
{{Further|Regulation and licensure in engineering}}
<!--
[[File:The Institution of Civil Engineers porch 2025-10-03.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Institution of Civil Engineers]], located in London, is the world's oldest professional civil engineering association.{{sfn|Watson|1988|pp=viii,14-16,53}}]]
-->
The profession of [[civil engineering]]{{snd}}which includes the discipline of bridge building{{snd}} began to be formalized in the 1700s when a school of engineering was created in France within the [[Corps des Ponts et Chaussées]] at the [[École de Paris (engineering)|École de Paris]], under the direction of [[Jacques Gabriel]].{{sfn|Bennett|1999|p=24}} In 1747 the first school dedicated to bridge building was founded, also in France: the [[École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées]]{{efn|Originally named '' Bureau des dessinateurs du Roi'', it was given its current name in 1775.}} led by engineers [[Daniel-Charles Trudaine]] and [[Jean-Rodolphe Perronet]].{{sfn|Bennett|1999|p=24}} The first professional organization focused on civil engineering was the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] founded in 1818 in the UK, initially led by [[Thomas Telford]].{{sfn|Watson|1988|pp=viii,14-16,53}}

In the modern era, bridge engineering is regulated by national organizations, such as the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]] (US), the [[Canadian Council of Professional Engineers]] (Canada), and the [[Engineering Council]] (UK).{{sfn|"The History of the National Council". ''NCEES''|pp=1,161, 366}} In many countries, bridge engineers must be licensed or meet minimal educational requirements.{{sfn|"Engineering: Issues Challenges and Opportunities". ''UNESCO''|pp=27-28, 135-136, 358-365 }} Some countries require engineers to pass qualification examinations, for example, in the US engineers must pass the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]] followed by the [[Principles and Practice of Engineering exam]].{{sfn|"Occupational Outlook Handbook". ''Department of Labor''|p=148}}  In Poland, bridge engineers are required to obtain certification by accumulating several years of experience under a senior engineer, and passing an exam administered by the  [[:pl:Polska_Izba_In%C5%BCynier%C3%B3w_Budownictwa|Polish Chamber of Civil Engineers]].{{sfn|Biliszczuk|2014|p=632}}  International cooperation in the field of engineering is facilitated by the [[World Federation of Engineering Organizations]].{{sfn|"The History of the National Council". ''NCEES'' |pp=70-71,88,123-125,366,377 }}

===Suicide===
[[Suicide]]s are sometimes committed by [[Suicide bridge|jumping off bridges]].  This method can account for 20% to 70% of suicides in urban areas with access to tall bridges.{{efn|In general, less than 10% of suicides are from jumping.{{sfn|Merli |Costanza |2024}}}}  In some regions, suicide by jumping  disproportionately affects young adults, who tend to have lower [[inhibitory control]].  Specific bridges can gain notoriety and attract persons experiencing a [[suicidal crisis]],  which creates a [[feedback loop]]. High-risk bridges often have [[Suicide barrier|suicide prevention barriers]] installed,{{efn|Arguments against installing suicide prevention measures include cost, aesthetics, and questions of effectiveness.{{sfn|Merli |Costanza |2024}}}} which   dramatically decrease the suicide rate on the bridge.{{efn|Barriers should be at least 2m tall, and extend the full length of the bridge.{{sfn|Merli |Costanza |2024}}}}  Installing barriers on a high-risk bridge generally reduces the jumping suicide rate in a region,  although in some instances, other bridges become substitutes.{{sfn|Merli |Costanza |2024}}
<!-- ===Numismatics===
[[File:EUR 500 reverse (2002 issue).jpg|alt=A colorful 500 euro bank note illustrated with a bridge and a map of Europe|thumb|The 500 [[euro]] banknote displays a cable-stayed bridge.<ref name=euro/>]]
Bridges have been featured on coins since antiquity.{{sfn|Markowitz |2016}} In 1996, the European Commission held a competition to select art for the [[euro banknotes]]. [[Robert Kalina]], an Austrian designer, won with a set of illustrations of bridges, chosen because they symbolize links between states in the union and with the future. The designs were supposed to be devoid of any identifiable characteristics, so as to not show favoritism to specific countries. But the initial designs by Kalina were discovered to be of specific bridges, including the [[Rialto]] and the [[Pont de Neuilly]], and so were changed to be more generic. Each banknote denomination depicts a bridge design representative of a certain architectural era.<ref name=euro>{{Multiref

The eras utilized for bridge images on Euro banknotes are: 
Classical (€5),
Romanesque (€10),
Gothic (€20),
Renaissance (€50),
Baroque and Rococo (€100),
19th century iron and glass (€200), and  20th century (€500).<ref name=euro/>}}-->
